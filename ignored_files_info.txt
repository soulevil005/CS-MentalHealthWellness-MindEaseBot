## 🔒 Files Not Included in This Repository (Important)

Some files and folders are intentionally NOT included in this GitHub project because they are auto-generated, too large, or system-specific.  
You do NOT need them to run the project.

### These files are NOT required and will not be present:

❌ `.venv/`  
Python virtual environment (large, system-specific)  
→ New users must recreate it using: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

❌ `.rasa/`  
Rasa cache, tracker DB, and temporary files (auto-generated)

❌ `*.keras` / `*.h5` model files  
Model files are typically large (>100MB)  
→ New users can retrain using: `rasa train` or your training script

❌ Large datasets  
Datasets are not stored on GitHub.  
→ Users must download them separately (instructions provided)

❌ System folders like `.config/`, `.idea/`, `.vscode/`  
These are personal environment configs.

---

### ✔ What users SHOULD download from GitHub:
- All **code files** (`.py`)
- All **Rasa config files** (`config.yml`, `domain.yml`)
- All **training data** (`nlu.yml`, `stories.yml`, `rules.yml`)
- **Dockerfile** & `docker-compose.yml`
- **actions/** folder
- **requirements.txt**
- **README.md**

After cloning, users just run:
pip install -r requirements.txt
rasa train


Everything else is auto-created.
